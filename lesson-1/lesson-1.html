    <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
    <h2>What is the internet?</h2>
    <p>
        Across the world the internet functions as a network that connects us. 
        We can visualize the internet as a web of connected nodes. This leads to
        someone corny images like this:
    </p>

    <div class="image">
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M">

                width="400"
            >
        </a>
    </div>

    <p> Here is a more accurage diagram to constrast:</p>

        </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
        Of these nodes, there are essentially 3 kinds:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>clients</dt>
        <dd>computers asking for webpages or data</dd>
        <dt>servers</dt>
        <dd>computers answering requests from the clients</dd>
        <dt>routers</dt>
        <dd>computers that are inbetween clients and servers that foward requests/responses to the correct place.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p> Here is a basic diagram where the large network of routers inbetween the client and server is simply called <b>the internet</b>:</p>
    <div class="image">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg">
    </div>

    <h2>What is a web application? Web page?</h2>
    <p>There is a large diversity of different kinds of data that can be sent between a client and server. But, when we 
        start speaking about <b>web applications</b>, we're talking about an entire program that is essentially 
        delivered to a client by a server. For example, google docs is a web application that allows someone to write a 
        document. It is very similar to microsoft word or pages, but it is a program that delivered to you laptop when you type
        <span style="background-color: beige; font-family: monospace; color: rgb(0, 94, 94);">docs.google.com</span> into 
        your web browser's search bar.
    </p>

    <p>An entire web application is pretty fully featured. To support all these features, the application probably has
        multiple <b>web pages</b>. For example, when you're using google docs, there is a page that allows you to edit a document
        and a page that allows you to browse documents you have already writen.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-parent">
        <div class="child1">
            <img src="https://gdm-catalog-fmapi-prod.imgix.net/ProductScreenshot/291090f3-2e00-4a01-8b63-4488e8d91541.png?auto=format&q=50" width="100%">
        </div>
        <div class="child2">
            <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_KJ3S7qOt20/maxresdefault.jpg" width="100%">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Because someone can only view one page a time in their web browser, 
        when a <b>client</b> makes a request of a <b>server</b>, the server will (generally) only deliver one web page.
    </p>

    <p>
        A single web page of an application can be thought of as being composed of 3 distinct parts.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>interface</dt>
        <dd>
            the code that describes the elements on the page that interacts with the user--text, buttons, dropdowns, etcetera
            --along with how they look.
        </dd>
        <dt>logic</dt>
        <dd>
            the code tied to a web page that describes the behaviors of the web page based on how the user interacts
            with it
        </dd>
        <dt>data</dt>
        <dd>
            the dynamic information of a web page that is filled in by either the server or the client
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        When creating web pages that compose a web application, the first part we will focus on is the interface. 
        This is because--and we will see this in future lessons--that the interface of a web page forms the skeleton
        of the page, while details of the web page (how it looks, its logic) will be--in a way--tacked onto this skeleton.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <p>
        Most web page <b>files</b> are written using a coding language called <b>HTML</b> (though there are few others). This stands for <i>hypertext markup language</i>.
        This coding language is standardized and is universally understood by nearly every <b>web browser</b>. When your web browser (the client) request a web page
        from a server, what is most often sent back over the internet is an <b>HTML</b> file. Your browser then reads and interprets this code in order to display
        the web page.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML uses text wrapped in <b>tags</b> to create the page's interface, these tags are essentially instructions for the browser. For example, if write:
    </p>

    <div class="grid-parent">
        <div class="html-render">
            <h3>About me</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="html-raw">
            <pre> &lt;h3&gt; About me &lt;/h3&gt; </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        I've written instructions inside my HTML file that tell the browser to create a heading (this is what the <span class="code">h3</span> tag means)
        that reads "About me"
    </p>

    <p>HTML is read sequentially, meaning instructions are read one after another. So if I write:</p>
    </p>

    <div class="grid-parent">
        <div class="html-render">
            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p> My favorite color is blue! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="html-raw">
            <pre> 
                &lt;h3&gt; About me &lt;/h3&gt;<br>
                &lt;p&gt; My favorite color is blue! &lt;/p&gt; 
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        I've written instructions inside my HTML file that tell the browser to create a heading that reads "About me" followed by a paragraph that contains the text 
        "My favorite color is blue!"
    </p>

    <h3>A note about blank spaces</h3>
    <p>
        When coding, most coders refer to blank spaces in their code as "whitespace". This comes from a time when every text editor was a program with black text on a 
        white background that looked like this:
    </p>

    <pre style="color: black; background-color: white;">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
        &lt;h3&gt; About me &lt;/h3&gt;<br>
        &lt;p&gt; My favorite color is blue! &lt;/p&gt; 
    </pre>

    <p>
        This is not really accurate anymore because most text editors come in a large variety of colors and most coders use non-white backgrounds because it is easier on your eyes.
        Unfortunately, this term is embedded in much of the literature you'll read about coding in general, so we are kind of stuck with it :/
    </p>

    <p>
        You may noticed already or not, in HTML the whitespace inbetween tags doesn't mean much. For example, here is alternative 
        with a bunch of added whitespace in the HTML code.
        Notice how it doesn't change what the browser shows at all:
    </p>

    <div class="grid-parent">
        <div class="html-render">
            <h3> About                     me</h3>
            <p> My      fav orite color      is        blue! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="html-raw">
            <pre style="white-space: pre;"> 
&lt;h3&gt; About                           me &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My      fav orite color      
is          blue! &lt;/p&gt; 
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>All the whitespace really does is tell the browser when two words are separate. Though, you must be careful. If you put whitespace inside a tag itself,
       this will cause a syntax error and might lead to some unexpected behavior.    
    </p>

    <div class="grid-parent">
        <div class="html-render">
            <    h 3> About                 me</h3>
            <p> My      fav orite color      is       blue! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="html-raw">
            <pre style="white-space: pre;"> 
&lt;    h 3&gt; About                       me &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My      fav orite color      
is          blue! &lt;/p&gt; 
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        As you've already seen, to create an HTML page, you must always start your document with:
    </p>

    <div>
        <pre> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        This is a formality and helps the browser identify what kind of file it is reading the same way a <b>file extension</b> does.
    </p>
