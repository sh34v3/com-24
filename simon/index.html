        <p>Simon says is a game of repition. When playing the game, a set of five tiles are shown to you. 
            On the first turn, a tile will flash and play a matching noise.
            You then must then click the tile flashed. 
            On second turn, two tiles flash in a specific order. The first will be the same,
            but the second will be brand new.
            Then you must click the same tiles in the same order.
            This continues on and on, while the pattern you must repeat gets longer an longer. The .gif
            to the right shows an example.
